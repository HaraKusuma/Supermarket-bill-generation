# Supermarket-bill-generation

A simple command-line supermarket billing system developed in Python. This project demonstrates how billing processes can be automated using basic programming concepts. Customers can view a catalog of predefined items, select products with quantities, and instantly generate a detailed bill. The program calculates the total price, applies a 5% GST, and prints a neatly formatted invoice that includes customer details and the current timestamp.

Features:

Item Catalog – Displays a predefined list of products with fixed prices

Quantity-based Calculation – Calculates cost based on user-entered quantity

Automatic GST – Adds 5% Goods and Services Tax to the bill

Invoice Generation – Produces a well-formatted bill with item details, total, GST, and final amount

Customer Details – Includes customer name and billing date/time

User-Friendly Interaction – Easy-to-use command-line prompts


This project is designed as a beginner-friendly Python application. It makes use of dictionaries to store product data, loops for item selection, and conditional logic for validating input. String formatting is used to generate the invoice, while Python’s built-in datetime module is utilized for printing the billing timestamp.
